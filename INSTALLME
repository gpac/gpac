Other Installation instructions for GPAC


* Foreword
	
	GPAC may be compiled without any third party libraries, but in this case its functionalities are very
limited (no still image, no audio, no video, no text, no scripting). It is therefore recommended to download the 
extra lib package available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/gpac. Compilation instructions for these libraries 
are provided per library in the package. 

	The current extra_lib package to use with gpac is gpac_extra_libs available here: 
http://download.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/gpac/gpac_extra_libs.zip

	In case you have some of these libs already installed on your system, the detailed list of dependencies is
	* freetype2 from version 2.1.4 on.
	* SpiderMonkey v1.7 (libjs from mozilla).
	* libjpg version 6b
	* Libpng version 1.2.33 (older versions should work)
	* MAD version 0.15.1b (older versions should work)
	* xvid version 1.0 (0.9.0 / .1 / .2 should also work)
