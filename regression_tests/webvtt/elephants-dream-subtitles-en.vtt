00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:48.542
<v Proog>Are you hurt?</v>

8
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Emo>I don't think so. You?</v>

9
00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:57.042
<v Proog>I'm Ok.</v>

10
00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:01.167
<v Proog>Get up. Emo, it's not safe here.</v>

11
00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:03.167
<v Proog>Let's go.</v>

12
00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:05.167
<v Emo>What's next?</v>

13
00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:09.208

<v Proog>Emo. This way.</v>

16
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.542
<v Proog>Follow me!</v>

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
(buzzing wires and chattery conversations)

18
00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:12.542
<v Proog>Hurry Emo!</v>

00:02:48.083 --> 00:02:50.000
<v Proog>You're not paying attention!</v>

22
00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:54.125
<v Emo>I just want to answer the... ...phone.</v>

23
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.042
<v Proog>Emo, look, I mean listen.</v>

24
00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:02.083
<v Proog>You have to learn to listen.</v>

25
00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:05.042
<v Proog>This is not some game.</v>

26
00:03:05.083 --> 00:03:09.417
<v Proog>You, I mean we, we could easily die out here.</v>

27
00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:14.042
<v Proog>Listen, listen to the sounds of the machine.</v>

28
00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:20.083
<v Proog>Listen to your breathing.</v>

29
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
(Buzzing wires)

30
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.500

<v Emo>Well, don't you ever get tired of this?</v>

33
00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Proog>Tired?!?</v>

34
00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:34.583
<v Proog>Emo, the machine is like clockwork.</v>

35
00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:37.167
<v Proog>One move out of place...</v>

36
00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:39.208
<v Proog>...and you're ground to a pulp.</v>

37
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.083
<v Emo>But isn't it -</v>

38
00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:46.125
<v Proog>Pulp, Emo! Is that what you want, pulp?</v>

39
00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:49.083
<v Proog>Emo, your goal in life...</v>

40
00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:52.042
<v Proog>...pulp?</v>

41
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.500
(loud metal sounds)

42
00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:43.125
<v Proog>Emo, close your eyes.</v>

43
00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:46.125
<v Emo>Why?</v> - <v Proog>Now!</v>

44
00:05:51.208 --> 00:05:52.208
<v Emo>Ok.</v>

45
00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:54.792
<v Proog>Good.</v>

46
00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:02.208
<v Proog>What do you see at your left side, Emo?</v>

47
00:06:04.083 --> 00:06:06.000
<v Emo>Nothing.</v> - <v Proog>Really?</v>

48
00:06:06.083 --> 00:06:07.208
<v Emo>No, nothing at all.</v>

49
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.083
<v Proog>And at your right, what do you see at your right side, Emo?</v>

50
00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:16.208
<v Emo>The same Proog, exactly the same...</v>

51
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.208
<v Emo>...nothing!</v> - <v Proog>Great.</v>

52
00:06:25.208 --> 00:06:27.208
(sound of camera flash)

53
00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:31.792
(engine drone)

54
00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:42.833
<v Emo>Listen Proog! Do you hear that!</v> (amusement park music)

55
00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:45.000
<v Emo>Can we go here?</v>

56
00:06:45.042 --> 00:06:48.000
<v Proog>There? It isn't safe, Emo.</v>

57
00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:52.125
<v Emo>But...</v> - <v Proog>Trust me, it's not.</v>

58
00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:54.208
<v Emo>Maybe I could...</v>

59
00:06:54.208 --> 00:06:56.083
<v Proog>No.</v>

60
00:06:57.167 --> 00:07:00.042
<v Proog>NO!</v>

61
00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:03.167
<v Proog>Any further questions, Emo?</v>

62
00:07:04.042 --> 00:07:05.208
<v Emo>No.</v>

63
00:07:09.125 --> 00:07:10.208
<v Proog>Emo?</v>

64
00:07:11.208 --> 00:07:13.125
<v Proog>Emo, why...</v>

65
00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:14.125
<v Proog>Emo...</v>

66
00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:18.125
<v Proog>...why can't you see the beauty of this place?</v>

67
00:07:18.208 --> 00:07:20.167
<v Proog>The way it works.</v>

68
00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:24.000
<v Proog>How perfect it is.</v>

69
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.083
<v Emo>No, Proog, I don't see.</v>

70
00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:30.083
<v Emo>I don't see because there's nothing there.</v>

71
00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:35.083
<v Emo>And why should I trust my life to something that isn't there?</v>

72
00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:37.042
<v Emo>Well can you tell me that?</v> - <v Proog>Emo...</v>

73
00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:39.042
<v Emo>Answer me!</v>

74
00:07:43.042 --> 00:07:44.125
<v Emo>Proog...</v>

75
00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:47.083
<v Emo>...you're a sick man!</v>

76
00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:49.042
<v Emo>Stay away from me!</v>

77
00:07:52.125 --> 00:07:55.000
<v Proog>No! Emo! It's a trap!</v>

78
00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:57.042
<v Emo>Hah, it's a trap.</v>

79
00:07:57.042 --> 00:08:01.167
<v Emo>At the left side you can see the hanging gardens of Babylon!</v>

80
00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:04.083
<v Emo>How's that for a trap?</v>

81
00:08:05.125 --> 00:08:07.042
<v Proog>No, Emo.</v>

82
00:08:09.083 --> 00:08:12.208
<v Emo>At the right side you can see... ...well guess what...</v>

83
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.792
<v Emo>...the colossus of Rhodes!</v>

84
00:08:15.208 --> 00:08:16.167
<v Proog>No!</v>

85
00:08:16.167 --> 00:08:22.042
<v Emo>The colossus of Rhodes and it is here just for you Proog.</v>

86
00:08:51.083 --> 00:08:53.042
<v Proog>It is there...</v>

87
00:08:53.042 --> 00:08:56.167
<v Proog>I'm telling you, Emo...</v>

88
00:08:57.083 --> 00:09:00.000
<v Proog>...it is, it is.</v>
