TODO
====

This file lists the TODO items stll pending for the 1.0 release.


Active Items to work on:
------------------------

* update vfw & dshow decoder frontends
  - GUI isn't perfect for vfw
* update/fix CBR plugin
  - misses target bitrate, bitrate burst in static motion/high motion
    transitions
* bug hunting (ed.gomez/syskin)
  - xvidcore is still a place where bugs feel confortable
* docbook writing (every developer should contribute)
  - New API has to be documented.
* two pass code should not introduce quality regressions (every tester)
  - first feedback proved kfthresholding was hurting quality, a
    decision on its behavior has to be settled.   
* MMX MPEG4 quantization is unprecise. This is probably an inherent
  problem in some MMX opcode precision.


Already completed items:
------------------------

* remove divx4 api (ed.gomez)
* remove VOP_TYPE enumerations (peter)

* New unix build process (ed.gomez)
* New thread/instance safe sse2 code (p.massimino)
