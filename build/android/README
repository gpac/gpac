* How to build GPAC for Android *
*********************************

To compile GPAC for Android, please execute the following steps:

1) Check out the GPAC GIT repository (but if you read this you probably already checkouted the GPAC repository):
 
	git clone https://github.com/gpac/gpac
	This directory will be reminded as <GPAC_DIR>

Get the extra lib packages from http://download.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/gpac/gpac_extra_libs.zip and unzip the archive.
This directory will be reminded as <GPAC_EXTRA_DIR>


2) Get the Android softwares:
 
	A. Download the Android SDK at http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html and unzip it at a place of your choice (referenced as <ANDROID_SDK_DIR>).
 
	B. Download the Android NDK at http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html and unzip it at a place of your choice (referenced as <ANDROID_NDK_DIR>).
		
	C. Download the Java Development Kit at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html (referenced as <JDK_DIR>)
 
	D. One of the following tools i) or ii) are needed for building the Android Package (APK):
		i)  GPAC provides scripts to build the APK from the shell. No IDE is needed.
				You will then ignore every step in this readme that follow the ii) mark (as it concerns only people using eclipse).

		ii) Eclipse IDE is useful if you want to go beyond the build (ie debug, add features, use the simulator etc). Firstly get Eclipse for java at http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/?osType=linux.
				Then get the ADT (Android Development Tools) plug-in in order to allow Eclipse to interact with Android tools at http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html and follow the instructions.
				You will then ignore every step in this readme that follow the i) mark (as it concerns only people using scripts to build the APK from the shell instead of Eclipse).
 
	E. Get and install SDK Component for Android:
 
		i)  If you build without IDE, launch <ANDROID_SDK_DIR>/tools/android. This opens a window. On the left panel, click on "Available packages", select "Android Repository" and then "Install Selected" (currently we use Android SDK Build-tools 23.0.3 and Android API 23).
 
		ii) If you have Eclipse Select Window->Preferences->Android and put the SDK directory path. Then select Window > Android SDK and AVD Managergo get the packages (Android repository packages are needed. The third party ones depend 	 					on the target devices. More informations at http://developer.android.com/sdk/adding-components.html.

3) Compile extra-libs for android 

	A. Unzip all libs
	
		Go to <GPAC_EXTRA_DIR>. Set the right to execute the unzip_all script (e.g. chmod +x unzip_all.sh)
		Run the script as follows :  ./unzip_all

	B. Build all extra-libs
	
		Go to <GPAC_EXTRA_DIR>/build/android. Set the right to execute the script gpac_build_all_extra_libs (e.g. chmod u+x gpac_build_all_extra_libs ).
		Run the script as follows : ./gpac_build_all_extra_libs <ANDROID_NDK_DIR>
	
		NOTE: In case there is an error compiling ffmpeg, make sure there is permission to execute the script compile_ffmpeg_android as well (e.g. chmod u+rxw compile_ffmpeg_android)
	
 	C. Copy all the compiled extra lib to the right folder
	
		Go back to <GPAC_EXTRA_DIR>
		Copy the just compiled libs into <GPAC_DIR>/extra_lib/lib/android by entering this command : 
		cp -r lib/android/* <GPAC_DIR>/extra_lib/lib/android/

4) Building GPAC for Android
 
	(optional) Links the Android SDK and NDK directories
    
		* cd /opt/
		* sudo ln -s /home/xxx/xxx/<Android SDK> android_sdk /* /opt/android_sdk will then become your new <ANDROID_SDK_DIR> */
		* sudo ln -s /home/xxx/xxx/<Android NDK> android_ndk /* /opt/android_ndk will then become your new <ANDROID_NDK_DIR> */

	i) Building Osmo4.apk without Eclipse

		 Go to GPAC_DIR/build/android/jni and launch the script 
		./gpac_build_android -ndk=<ANDROID_NDK_DIR> -sdk=<ANDROID_SDK_DIR> -jdk=<JDK_DIR>
		It will generate the package Osmo4.apk.
		You can find the APK in GPAC_DIR/applications/osmo4_android_studio/app/build/outputs/apk
 
  ii)Building Osmo4.apk with Eclipse

		Go to GPAC_DIR/build/android/jni and launch the script 
		./gpac_build_android <ANDROID_NDK_DIR>
			** Warning, two messages will appear to alert you didnt provide any link to JDK and to the Android SDK . **
		** These message inform you that the script can't build the Osmo4.apk package on it's own and that you'll need eclipse to build it.**
		Start Eclipse and select File->Import->General->Existing projects into Workspace and open the directory <GPAC_DIR>/applications/osmo4_android. 
		Build the package and it is created in <GPAC_DIR>/applications/osmo4_android/bin.
