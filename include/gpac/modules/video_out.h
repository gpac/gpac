			video output interface

	the video output may run in 2 modes: 2D and 3D.

	** the 2D video output works by accessing a backbuffer surface on the video mem board - 
	the app accesses to the surface through the GF_VideoSurface handler. 
	The module may support HW blitting of RGB or YUV data to backbuffer.

	** the 3D video output only handles window management and openGL contexts setup.
	The context shall be setup in Resize and SetFullScreen calls which are always happening in the main 
	rendering thread. This will take care of openGL context issues with multithreading

	By default all modules are required to be setup in 2D. If 3D is needed, a GF_EVENT_VIDEO_SETUP will
	be sent with the desired configuration.

	Except Setup and Shutdown functions, all interface functions are called through the main compositor thread
	or its user to avoid multithreading issues. Care must still be taken when handling events
