	</section>
	<section name="RecentFiles">
		The "RecentFiles" section of the config file holds last accessed files (hardcoded to no more than 20) in the last access order. The keys are the file names and no value is used. This section is only used by GUI clients (osmo4/wxOsmo4) 
	</section>
	<section name="Systems">
		<key name="LanguageName" type="string" default="" usage="basic">
			Specifies the user prefered language in readable english. This is used to select streams in case of alternate content in an audio object. 
		</key>
		<key name="Language3CC" type="string" default="" usage="basic">
			Specifies the user prefered language as expressed in ISO 639-2. This is used to select streams in case of alternate content in an audio object. 
		</key>
		<key name="Language2CC" type="string" default="" usage="basic">
			Specifies the user prefered language as expressed in ISO 639-1. This is used to select streams in case of alternate content in an audio object. 
		</key>		
		<key name="DrawLateFrames" type="" default="yes" usage="basic">
			If set, late frames will still be drawn. If not set, the late frames are droped (or executed for systems decoders) untill the decoder output is back in sync. This is by default on to keep better testing heavy content or slow renderers, but should be set to off when needing a better sync or monitoring skipped frames. 
		</key>
		<key name="ForceSingleClock" type="" default="no" usage="basic">
			One big problem with MP4 files is that the notion of "duration" has been unclear for a long time, and most content available (audio-video files) specifiy a wrong BIFS duration. In such a case the movie cannot be controled/seeked into. Another problem with ISMA streaming is that BIFS/OD don't use the same clock as audio/video, thus seeking the main timeline does not seek AV media. Setting the ForceSingleClock will handle both cases by using a single timeline for all media streams and setting the duration to the one of the longest stream
		</key>
		<key name="ThreadingPolicy" type="enum('Free', 'Single', 'Multi')" default="Free" usage="basic">
			Specifies how media decoders are to be threaded. "Free" lets decoders decide of their threading, "Single" means that all decoders are managed in a single thread performing scheduling and priority handling and "Multi" means that each decoder runs in its own thread. 
		</key>
		<key name="Priority" type="enum('low','normal','high','real-time')" default="normal" usage="basic">
			Specifies the priority of the decoders (priority is applied to decoder thread(s) regardless of threading mode). 
		</key>
		<key name="TimeSlice" type="uint" default="0" usage="basic">
			Specifies the target maximum time (in ms) of one cycle of the media manager (the media manager will attempts to call all the active decoders within this time. Depending on the threading mode this option can be ignored.
		</key>
		<key name="ModuleUnload" type="boolean" default="yes" usage="basic">
			Specifies whether modules should be unloaded if not used or not. Default: "yes". 
		</key>
		<key name="ResyncLateClock" type="uint" default="0" usage="basic">
			Specifies the threshold after which late clocks are resynchronized to timestamps for OCR streams. By default, no threashold (0) is used and clocks are never resynchronized. This allows to resync clocks to the media owning the clock when the decoding is really too slow, and should only be used for debugging purposes. 
		</key>
		<key name="NoVisualThread" type="boolean" default="no" usage="basic">
			Specifies whether the visual rendering is done in the main codec manager or in a dedicated thread. 
		</key>
		<key name="DefAudioDec" type="string" default="" usage="basic">
			Specifies which module to use by default for audio decoding. The string is the name of the module to be used (same considerations as other modules, cf introduction). 
		</key>
		<key name="DefVideoDec" type="string" default="" usage="basic">
			Specifies which module to use by default for video decoding. The string is the name of the module to be used (same considerations as other modules, cf introduction). 
		</key>
		<key name="DefImageDec" type="string" default="" usage="basic">
			Specifies which module to use by default for image decoding. The string is the name of the module to be used (same considerations as other modules, cf introduction). 
		</key>
		<key name="codec_*" type="string" default="" usage="basic">
			Allows to specify default media module (audio/video) per stream type and object type. This is useful if you have more than one decoder for a given type (ex, XviD and FFMPEG for MPEG-4 visual SP). The syntax is:<br></br>
			codec_AA_BB=modulename<br></br>
			where AA is the hexadecimal MPEG-4 streamType value for the codec (04=visual, 05=audio) and BB is the hexadecimal MPEG-4 objectTypeIndication of the media (0x20 = MPEG-4 video, 0x40=MPEG-4 Audio, ...). The string is the name of the module to be used (same considerations as other modules, cf introduction). 
		</key>
 	</section>
	<section name="Network">
		<key name="BufferLength" type="uint" default="3000" usage="basic">
			Specifies the length of the decoding buffer in milliseconds. The client will wait for the buffer to be filled before starting decoding. A module may decide to use a different value based on protocol and network jitters.
		</key>
 	</section>
	<section name="DASH">
		<key name="LowLatency" type="enum('always', 'chunk', 'no')" default="no" usage="basic">
			Sets low-latency mode enabled. In low-latency mode, media data is parsed as soon as possible while segment is being downloaded. Default is no. If chunk is selected, media data is re-parsed at each HTTP 1.1 chunk end. If always is selected, media data is re-parsed as soon as HTTP data is received.
