README for GPAC version 0.9.0-DEV

# Introduction

GPAC is a multimedia framework oriented towards rich media and distributed under the LGPL license (see COPYING).

GPAC supports many multimedia formats, from simple audiovisual containers (avi, mov, mpg) to complex  presentation formats (MPEG-4 Systems, SVG Tiny 1.2, VRML/X3D) and 360 videos. GPAC supports presentation scripting for MPEG4/VRML/X3D through mozilla SpiderMonkey javascript engine.

GPAC currently supports local file playback, HTTP progressive download, Adaptive HTTP Streaming (MPEG-DASH, HLS), RTP/RTSP streaming over UDP (unicast or multicast) or TCP,  TS demuxing (from file, IP or DVB4Linux), ATSC 3.0 ROUTE sessions, desktop grabbing, camera/microphone inputs and any input format supported by FFmpeg.

For more information, visit the [GPAC website](http://gpac.io)

GPAC is being developped at [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/), in the [MultiMedia group](http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/mm/), by many [great contributors](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/graphs/contributors)

GPAC includes the following applications built by default:
## MP4Box
MP4Box is a multi-purpose MP4 file manipulation for the prompt, featuring media importing and extracting, file inspection, DASH segmentation, RTP hinting, ... See `MP4Box -h`, `man MP4Box` or [our wiki](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/wiki/MP4Box-Introduction).


## MP4Client
MP4Client is a media player built upon libgpac, featuring a rich media interactive composition engine with MPEG-4 BIFS, SVG, VRML/X3D support.
For GPAC configuration instruction, check `MP4Client -h` ,  `man MP4Client` or [our wiki](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/wiki/mp4client).

## gpac 
As of version 0.9.0, GPAC includes a filter engine in charge of stream management and used by most applications in GPAC - [check this](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/wiki/Rearchitecture) for more dicussion on how this impacts MP4Box and MP4Client.
The gpac application is a direct interface to the filter engine of GPAC, allowing any combinaison of filers not enabled by other applications. See `gpac -h`, `man gpac`, `man gpac-filters` or [our wiki](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/wiki/Filters) for more details.

# Testing
GPAC has a test suite exercicing most features of the framework. Check the [tests readme](tests/README.md) for more details. Per-commit [build](https://buildbot.gpac.io/) and [tests results](https://tests.gpac.io) are available.

# Compilation and Installation
