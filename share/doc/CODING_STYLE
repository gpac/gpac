GPAC coding style

Introduction
  coding styles only concern the GPAC core library (libgpac), and should be used for external filters and modules development.
  
  AStyle is a code beautifier tool. Code should be compliant with the following pattern provided by AStyle :
  AStyle -r --indent=tab '*.c' '*.h' '*.cpp' '*.hpp'
    
1 Exported symbols 

  1.0 Informative note
  The GF_ or gf_ stands for "gpac framework"

  1.1 typedef of structures - typedef of base types - typedef of functions

All symbols defined within libgpac library and exported for application development purposes shall begin with GF_* 
with the first character of "*" being in capital, regardless of their functionality.
For example, GF_Thread (structure), GF_Err (redefined type), GF_LineCap (enum typedef)
    
All structure typedefs, whether defined (declaration exported through ehaders) or not (declaration intern to the GPAC core lib), must follow
this principle.
Furthermore, typedef of non-exported structure shall only apply to the structure itself, not a pointer to it. 
    typedef struct _my_gpac_thingy *GF_LPMYGPACSTUFF;    /*this is FORBIDDEN*/
    typedef struct _my_gpac_thingy GF_MyGPACStuff;    /*this is OK*/
This will allow easy exporting of structure declaration if needed at some point in the development.


  1.2 constants

All constants (whether #defines or enums) shall be in capital letters and begin with "GF_" and use "_" for word separation
For example, error code GF_BAD_PARAM.

Enums names shall refer to the main module they are used in through a keyword right after the GF_ .
For example, 
  * enums referring to file format (isomedia) will be prefixed by GF_ISOM_
  * enums referring to MPEG-4 OD tools (odf) will be prefixed by GF_ODF_
  
  1.3 functions

All exported functions and pointer to functions shall begin with "gf_". The name shall refer to the main module they are sued in 
through a keyword right after the gf_ when reasonable (gf_isom_, gf_odf_, gf_filter_), or to the tool they refer to (gf_bs_, gf_url, ...)
  
2 Miscalleanous

All exported functions' names shall be in lower case exclusively.
All exported functions' parameters should be in lower case exclusively.
Exported structures may use case in any fashion as long as they respect the rules expressed in section 1 above.
Exported structures member should preferably all be lower case - this may not be feasible for scene graph nodes & like...

All exported header files shall be in lower case
All source files within the gpac core shall be in lower case

All comments should be C-like ones (/**/) not C++ ones (//)
All exported headers documentation should be written with doxygen syntax
All constructor-like functions should be of style gf_zzz_new
All destructor like functions should be of style gf_zzz_del
