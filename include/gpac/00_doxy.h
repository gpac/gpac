\defgroup jsapi_grp JavaScript APIs
\brief JavaScript API available in GPAC

Parts of the GPAC code can be scriptable using JavaScript. This part of the documentation describes the various APIs used in GPAC.

For SVG and DOM scenegraph API, see https://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/svgudom.html.

For BIFS and VRML scenegraph, see https://www.web3d.org/documents/specifications/14772/V2.0/part1/javascript.html

SVG and BIFS APIs are automatically loaded when loading an SVG or BIFS scene with script nodes. They cannot be loaded in another way.


The JSFilter API is loaded through a dedicated filter, see `gpac -h jsf`.

All other APIs shall be loaded by the parent script (scene or JSFilter) as ECMAScript modules using the `import` directive.

GPAC uses the amazing QuickJS engine for JavaScript support: https://bellard.org/quickjs/quickjs.html. Although not JIT-enabled, it is small, fast and cross-platform which ensures the same behaviour on all devices.

The module loader is the same as the QuickJS libc module loader (https://bellard.org/quickjs/quickjs.html#Modules), except that it checks for .so, .dll or .dylib extensions for C modules.

This means that JS C modules as defined in QuickJS could also be used (https://bellard.org/quickjs/quickjs.html#C-Modules)
\warning support for C modules is still not fully tested

There is currently no support for non-local modules (http, https ...).

GPAC constants used in the API (error code, property types, specific flags for functions) are exported:
- using the same name as native code, e.g. GF_STATS_LOCAL, GF_FILTER_SAP_1, etc...
- in the global object of the javascript context

Unless indicated otherwise, all errors are handled through exceptions. An exception object contains a code (integer) attribute and optionnally a message (string) attribute.


Types and interfaces are described using WebIDL, see https://heycam.github.io/webidl/, with some slight modifications.
\warning These IDL files are only intended to document the APIs, and are likely useless for other purposes.
