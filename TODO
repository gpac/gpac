todo items as of version 0.4.5:
	* more refinement for several top scenes support (display overlays & co).

utopic roadmap
v0.5.0:
	* maybe support for glyph-based texturing rather than string-based
	* SMIL support ?
	
v0.6.0:
	* M4Flex (ex FlexMux) support
	* Flexible IPMP integration
	* JNI interfacing and MPEG-J APIs
	* native SWF support in client ?

v1.0.0:
	* full rendering (MPEG-4 AFX ?)

Future work on authoring tools is not still well defined. The current state has bt/vrml/XMT-A support, it could be interesting to have XMT-O support. The SWF converter
still needs lots of work to support ActionScript and co but this will likely not be developed by your servitor. Other graphics converter are more-or-less droped.
The main authoring focus should now be a better V4Studio-like app, to create simple content as well as act as a live studio.


droped items:
* Hardware accelerated 2D raster: from most doc on OpenGL and co, there is no waranty of any kind that backbuffer content is not altered when swaping buffers. 
This is a big issue since the 2D renderer main strength is to compute diffs between frames... 2D acceleration is however available with the 3D renderer
* MatteTexture fix: given the lack of acceleration in 2D, the matteTexture in the 2D renderer will be just to slow to be usable, and therefore won't be fixed
for a while... MatteTexture with the 3D renderer will be fixed however, trying to use openGL texenv stuff and multitexturing
