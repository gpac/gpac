Description: multimedia framework based on the MPEG-4 Systems standard
 The main development goal is to provide a clean (a.k.a. readable by as many
 people as possible), small and flexible alternative to the MPEG-4 Systems
 reference software (known as IM1 and distributed in ISO/IEC 14496-5). The
 MPEG-4 Reference software is indeed a very large piece of software,
 designed to verify the standard rather than provide a small,
 production-stable software.
