Installation instructions for GPAC 0.4.3 - November 2006:


* Foreword
	
	GPAC may be compiled without any third party libraries, but in this case its functionalities are very
limited (no still image, no audio, no video, no text, no scripting). It is therefore recommended to download the 
extra lib package available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/gpac. Compilation instructions for these libraries 
are provided per library in the package. 
	The current extra_lib package to use with gpac 0.4.3 is gpac_extra_libs 0.4.0.

	In case you have some of these libs already installed on your system, the detailed list of dependencies is
	* freetype2 from version 2.1.4 on.
	* SpiderMonkey v1.5 RC 4 (libjs from mozilla - you will need gmake to compile this one). RC5 and RC6 can be used but need
	changes in /include/gpac/setup.h or configure script
	* libjpg version 6b
	* Libpng version 1.2.5 
	* MAD version 0.15.1b (older versions should work)
	* xvid version 1.0 (0.9.0 / .1 / .2 should also work)
	* ffmpeg 25 June 2005 CVS version
	* libogg 1.1, libvorbis 1.1 and libtheora 1.0 from Xiph.org
	* faad2, version 2.0 or 2.1 (CVS from www.audiocoding.com)

	Windows user are invited to download and install the Microsoft Platform SDK at
