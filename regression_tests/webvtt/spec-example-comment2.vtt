This file was written by Jill. I hope
you enjoy reading it. Some things to
bear in mind:
- I was lip-reading, so the cues may
not be 100% accurate
- I didn't pay too close attention to
when the cues should start or end.

00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
Never drink liquid nitrogen.

NOTE check next cue

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
— It will perforate your stomach.
— You could die.
