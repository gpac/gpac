# 21/07/06: GPAC 0.4.2
  - commit of GPAX (GPAC ActiveX) - controller only works in IE and ActiveX control tester for now.
  - API changes to Osmozilla to keep in sync with GPAX. Sample html file can be found in applications/GPAX.
     - both plugin now support browser navigation (ie link to html within MPEG-4 content)
     - Plugins can be used to modify the presentation from a parent HTML doc
     - check sample files in regression tests for more details
  - iTune tagging support, (patch from Andrew Voznytsa with slight modif). Tagging can be done with MP4Box -itags option. The tags are passed in a single string, separated by ':', formatted as 'tag_name=tag_value'. Supported tags names are: album, artist, comment, compilation, composer, created, disk, encoder, genre, name, tempo, track, tracknum, writer.
     NOTE: to make sure you mp4 is importable on an iPod, you must:
       - use .m4a extension
       - specify the right brands: MP4Box -brand "M4A " -ab mp42
     This process is automated in MP4Box for all file with extension .m4a
  - added MPEG-1/2 raw importing (extensions: .m1v and .m2v).
  - cleanup of all Makefiles: 
      no more recursive makes for libgpac
      gpac can now be compiled outside the main source tree with gcc, eg $ ~/cvs/test>../gpac/configure
  - Support for VobSub import and export (.idx) thanks to a great patch from Falco !
  - initial version of MPEG-2 TS demuxer (MP4Box and client plugin)
      program-based import for MPEG-2 TS streams (MP4Box -add file.ts#program=ProgName).
  - initial IPV6 support
  - MP42AVI is now deprecated. MP4Client can now be used to produce uncompressed bmp/raw/AVI, dumping the complete presentattion rather than just BIFS scenes (audio is currently not extracted). Usage:
     MP4Client -bmp 1-2.5-3 file.mp4 take screenshots of file.mp4 aty T=1, 2.5 and 3 seconds
     MP4Client -avi -fps 15.0 -size 176x144 file.mp4 produces an uncompressed AVI of resolution 176x144, framerate 15
     MP4Client -avi 4-10 file.mp4 produces an uncompressed AVI of the scene between 4 and 10 seconds
      Check MP4Client man page for more details.
  - added support for major brand versioning in MP4Box: "-brand GPAC:2" will set the major brand to GPAC, with a version of 2.
  - regression tests (.bt and .x3dv) are now part of GPAC source tree
     changed all audio and video media in regression tests.
  - added 2D/3D selection param for osmozilla: use3d="true" or use3d="false" to force renderer used.
  - added support for importing AMR/SMV/EVRC file missing their magic number
  - moved all language handling to both ISO 639-1 (2 char code) and 639-2 (3 char code), as 639-1 is used in SVG.
  - removed old XML parser, all parsing now relies on a new GPAC SAX parser (avoid dependency on libxml when unneeded).
    - support for progressive loading support for XMT and X3D files.
    - new svg_in module using gpac sax parser (supports progressive loading too)
    - cf configuration.html or man gpac for more info on progressive loading control
  - added 'define' support in BT - to use it just do:
     #define symbol blab labl a
    and reuse the symbol in the BT text. This may be quite buggy, but it can be useful
  - support for Scene Carousel in hinters, core and rtp reassembler. Currently only BIFS and BIFS+AV can be use the scene carousel, carouseling of 
    static data (eg images) is not supported. The OD data must be embedded in the IOD a la ISMA.
  - added FPS and size info dumping for MPEG and AVI file import (MP4Box -info file.mpg)
  - improved 3D renderer while checking the X3D conformance suite
  - changed MPEG-4 SP -> AVI to add VOSH before each I-frame
  - Experimental support for LASeR (encoder, decoder and decoder module). 
    - Far from behing complete or usable at this time, binary syntax not 100% safe and COR to standard is in edition stage...
    - LASeR RAP generation in MP4Box
    - added SAF (LASeR Simple Aggregation Format) support: mux and demux (MP4Box) + SAF input plugin.
    Basic LASeR usage: 
      encoding: MP4Box -mp4 file.svg, MP4Box -saf file.svg
      decoding: MP4Box -svg file.mp4, MP4Box -xsr file.mp4 (dumps to LASeRML format)
  - added patch from FT R&D for simple anim mask encoding needed for FAP/BAP streams on FDT/BDP nodes.
  - added patch for drift-controled interleaving (interleaves while trying to keep chunk synchronized). This is now the storage mode of MP4Box, old interleaving is possible with -old-inter option.
  - added support for tight interleaving without hinting in MP4Box.
  - added support for delayed concatenation (-cat file.mp4:delay=2000 test.mp4)
  - added "-name" option to MP4Box (track import and general cmd line opt) for setting the track handler name
  - More SVG improvements and features:
    - support for SVG scripting (ecmascript through SpiderMonkey) - a good subset of microDOM is supported (!! presentation traits are missing).
    - support for SVG events (DOM)
    - support for SVG scene dumping
    - SVG Tiny 1.2 gradients + gradient matrix (1.1 feature)
    - SVG.preserveAspectRatio support
    - system color paint 
    - basic conditional processing (switch)
    - SMIL anim events (begin, end, restart)
  - added PAR modification support to MP4Box (import time and file based)
  - improved precision of IsoMedia file splitting
  - added NHML import/export. NHML is an XML representation of the NHNT file, with add-ons and a more flexible way of integrating media. Doc to come on web site
  - clean-up of 2D direct rendering mode: 
      * no more bounds tracking for less memory usage
      * automatically mode switch to direct rendering when using slide navigation (pan&zoom)
  - clean-up of soft raster: 
      * removed all bezier curbs handling, let gpac core handle those
      * paths are now always flatten to reduce rastering times
      * misc optimizations of scanline converter (no more Y-sorting, only X-sorting used)
  - speed improvements in BT/WRL loader
  - updated makefiles for compilation under GPE
  - made FreeType plugin log unknown fonts in general cfg file to speed up font selection.
  - changed module naming - all modules are now prefixed with "gm_", and module is loaded/unloaded at run-time
  - changed isomedia file open API for better support of temporary directories
  - simplified 2D blitter for non DirectX output: no more in-middle surface used, direct stretch, blit and yuv conversion to back buffer
  - added software and hardware support for MaterialKey in 2D renderer
  - Support for SP2003 and PPC2003
    - added all project files for evc4

	- 3GPP/MPEG4 timed text decoder - supports everything except soft wrap & dynamic highlighting (karaoke) - vertical text not fully tested
	- new "ttxt" format (for "timed text"): XML representation of 3GPP/MPEG4 timed text streams - importer (from ttxt and from srt) and dumper (to ttxt only) support.
	- MP4Box "-ttxt" option: converts an SRT file to a TTXT one.
	- Input plugin for ttxt and srt files.
	- Support for "dynamic scenes", eg gpac will now generate on the fly a scene description when none is found, and allows stream selection in GUI.
	- Modified Osmo4 & wxOsmo4 GUI: stream selection & subtitle adding
	- Changed MP4Box "-import" to "-convert" ("-import" is kept for backward compatibility).
	- Added MP4Box -nosys (removes all MPEG-4 systems streams and writes an empty IOD)
	- Added MP4Box "-add": adds any supported format to an mp4 file (same input conventions as -convert). Several input can be specified (ex: -add audio1.aac -add sub1.srt video.mp4 -out full_movie.mp4)
	- fixed a nasty bug in RTSP stack screwing up all mediaControl & rtsp session.
	- 3D NonLinearDeformer (AFX) support (taper, twister and bender)
	- Completed X3D geometry set: LineSet, (Indexed)TriangleSet, (Indexed)TriangleStripSet, (Indexed)TriangleFanSet 
	- Full multichannel audio mixing and resampling (and better audio speed support). Multichannel->stereo conversion (not configurable atm).
	- Yet Another Announcement of a stable ffmpeg demuxer - stable with avi & mpeg, still sync issues with some QT files (same issues with ffplay).
	- added SBR mode for aac importing ('-sbr' switch) in MP4Box.
	- fixed: MP4Box hinters (empty tracks), SDL -> BIFS coord mapping in fullscreen, rounding segmentDescriptor.startTime pbs in seeking with mp4menu
	- Added Playlist and brower-like navigation to Osmo4 and wxOsmo4
	- AAC/ADTS file & streaming input (radios) - FAAD decoder moved to aac_in plugin
	- ADTS import/extraction in MP4Box
	- fixed OD XMT-A for ESD.OCR_ES_ID and ESD.dependsOn_ES_ID (now use IDREFs and not binary IDs)
	- integrated ogg lib in gpac (<gpac/m4_ogg.h>), and added ogg/vorbis and ogg/theora importers to mp4 - THIS IS NOT STANDARD AT ALL. 
		The current syntax is to put needed headers in the MPEG-4 DecoderSpecificInfo, with the following syntax:
			u16 sizeof_header;
			char *header_data;
		for each header (quite similar to what is found in qtcomponents). Vorbis ObjectTypeIndication is 0xDE, theora ObjectTypeIndication is 0xDF.
		Need some more testing before filing a request to mp4ra.org.
		Streaming possible as MPEG-4 streams, Vorbis RTP packetizer still to be done. 
	
# 09/11/04: GPAC 0.2.2 release
	- Xiph OGG demuxer: supports file, http download (not tested) and icecast servers.
	- Xiph Vorbis decoder
	- Xiph Theora support (should work with fluendo but I can't get any data from the server...)
	- Better FFMPEG support (moved to latest ffmpeg cvs tarball).
	- all file associations in client are made through mime types, and changed handling of service (mime type query if possible before loading plugin)
	- network stats & changed all UIs for that.
	- decoder stats & changed all UIs for that.
	- nicer Osmo4/wxGTK
	- shoutcast support in mp3 reader
	- Install doc cleanup
	- MP4Box "-single" option now work for 3GP files
	- MP4Box "-rem TrackID" option to remove a track
	- made 3GP hinter produce QT-compatible streams (as usual QT only accepts specific RTP timescales)
	- moved M4Systems to a dynamic lib (static is still first built & used for MP4Box)
	- moved all scene decoders (bifs, OD and context loader) to real plugins
	- moved BT & XMT parsers from stdio to ZLIB io, in order to support GZIPed VRML & X3D (and consequently, BT and XMT-A ;). GPAC CAN NO LONGER COMPILE WITHOUT ZLIB
	- massive cleanups in scenegraph & MPEG-4 node naming convention
	- !!!scene graph no longer customizable without code hacking!!!
	- X3D scene graph generator (decided NOT TO SUPPORT VRML 97 extensions, since they are in X3D and with a different format...)
	- updated vrml tools for X3D support (Double precision coords & RGBA colors)
	- culling of AABB tree against frustum at draw stage in 3D renderer - greatly speeds up large meshes & terrains rendering
	- support for weird cyclic graphs in scenegraph (mainly to support encoding of conditionals). Works with nodes as well, configurable through scenegraph but this can 
	likely crash a renderer other than GPACs (tested with blaxxun & old GPAC versions, crash works each time:)
	- lighting and transformations now properly set in 3D renderer 
	- improved gravity (ground detection) and added jump in walk mode (right click or 'j')
