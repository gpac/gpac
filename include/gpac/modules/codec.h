Add a Stream to the codec. If DependsOnESID is NULL, the stream is a base layer
UpStream means that the decoder should send feedback on this channel.
WARNING: Feedback format is not standardized by MPEG
the same API is used for both encoder and decoder (decSpecInfo is ignored
for an encoder)
@DetachStream:
Remove stream
@GetCapabilities:
Get the desired capability given its code
@SetCapabilities
Set the desired capability given its code if possible
if the codec does not support the request capability, return GF_NOT_SUPPORTED
@CanHandleStream
Can module handle this codec? Return one of GF_CODEC_NOT_SUPPORTED, GF_CODEC_MAYBE_SUPPORTED or GF_CODEC_SUPPORTED
esd is provided for more advanced inspection ( eg MPEG4 audio/visual where a bunch of codecs are defined with same objectType). If esd is NULL, only
decoder type is checked (audio or video), not codec type
@GetDecoderName
returns codec name - only called once the stream is successfully attached

user defined.
