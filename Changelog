28/07/05: GPAC 0.4.0 release
  ** GPAC is now licensed under LGPL. **
  Massive code rewrite and repository reorganization in order to comply to some base coding style (cf gpac/doc/CODING_STYLE) have taken place 
  since previous release. Documentation is still a work in progress.
  APIs are not backward compatible, but should now be in a frozen state/spelling for the most common tools (utils, MPEG-4 OD, IsoMedia and terminal APIs)
    
  - Fixed FAAD multichannel support with latest FAAD CVS version (bug due to FAAD inner channel creation). Latest version should 
    support both multichannel and AAC radios.
  - added support for normal drawing (for debug purposes) in 3D renderer
  - adedd support for single instance of Osmo4/w32 
  - changed audio configuration options to "Number of buffers" and "TotalDuration"

	  your binaries!! Also updated ffmpeg plugin to new ffmpeg API
	- moved all fullscreen handling to dedicated windows, refinement of wxOsmo4.
	- more work on x11 plugin (events handling, 3D support) - THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL AT THIS RELEASE LEVEL, CHECKOUT CVS FOR BETTER SUPPORT...
  - fixed anamorphic video handling in GPAC, both playing (2D and 3D) and MP4Box parsers (only done for MPEG-4 Visual, not AVC). Video is
    now only rescaled at blit time
  - changed ';' separators to ':' seprators in MP4Box (meta options and track import options) for linux prompt compatibility.
  - misc fixes in tx3g track import, tx3g bt dump and couple of issues introduced in 0.3.0->0.4.0 migration
  - misc cleanup of GF_VideoOutput interface.
	- started doc manager using doxygen (doxyfile added in gpac/doc). APIs may be slightly reworked during the documentation phase. 
		Documentation will only be produced for libgpac, eg all exported headers in gpac/include/gpac
		Development APIs documentation (gpac/include/gpac/internal) will come later.
	- cleaned up IsoMedia reading for more efficient and more reliable parsing
  - misc fixes in MP4Box option parsing, in RTP multicast setup
  - Osmozilla should now be much more stable on Win32 - Linux version to come.

	- Changed NetClientPluggin API (got rid of status query, status handled internally in ESM and in plugin if needed)
	- Updated evc3 projects, made M4Systems READ/WRITE on CE to enable timedtext parsing (and future streaming cache, who knows ...).
	- Added 3GPP text hinting in MP4Box and 3GPP text reassembler in rtp plugin.
	- Bug fixes and testing of 3GP timed text with some 3GP files
	- GF_InlineScene now supports MediaControl with mediaStartTime and mediaStopTime
	- AAC SBR import now uses backward compatible decoder config.
	- 3GPP/MPEG4 timed text decoder - supports everything except soft wrap & dynamic highlighting (karaoke) - vertical text not fully tested
	- new "ttxt" format (for "timed text"): XML representation of 3GPP/MPEG4 timed text streams - importer (from ttxt and from srt) and dumper (to ttxt only) support.
	- MP4Box "-ttxt" option: converts an SRT file to a TTXT one.
	- Input plugin for ttxt and srt files.
	- Support for "dynamic scenes", eg gpac will now generate on the fly a scene description when none is found, and allows stream selection in GUI.
	- Modified Osmo4 & wxOsmo4 GUI: stream selection & subtitle adding
	- Changed MP4Box "-import" to "-convert" ("-import" is kept for backward compatibility).
	- Added MP4Box -nosys (removes all MPEG-4 systems streams and writes an empty IOD)
	- Added MP4Box "-add": adds any supported format to an mp4 file (same input conventions as -convert). Several input can be specified (ex: -add audio1.aac -add sub1.srt video.mp4 -out full_movie.mp4)
	- fixed a nasty bug in RTSP stack screwing up all mediaControl & rtsp session.
	- 3D NonLinearDeformer (AFX) support (taper, twister and bender)
	- Completed X3D geometry set: LineSet, (Indexed)TriangleSet, (Indexed)TriangleStripSet, (Indexed)TriangleFanSet 
	- Full multichannel audio mixing and resampling (and better audio speed support). Multichannel->stereo conversion (not configurable atm).
	- Yet Another Announcement of a stable ffmpeg demuxer - stable with avi & mpeg, still sync issues with some QT files (same issues with ffplay).
	- added SBR mode for aac importing ('-sbr' switch) in MP4Box.
	- fixed: MP4Box hinters (empty tracks), SDL -> BIFS coord mapping in fullscreen, rounding segmentDescriptor.startTime pbs in seeking with mp4menu
	- Added Playlist and brower-like navigation to Osmo4 and wxOsmo4
	- AAC/ADTS file & streaming input (radios) - FAAD decoder moved to aac_in plugin
	- ADTS import/extraction in MP4Box
	- fixed OD XMT-A for ESD.OCR_ES_ID and ESD.dependsOn_ES_ID (now use IDREFs and not binary IDs)
	- integrated ogg lib in gpac (<gpac/m4_ogg.h>), and added ogg/vorbis and ogg/theora importers to mp4 - THIS IS NOT STANDARD AT ALL. 
		The current syntax is to put needed headers in the MPEG-4 DecoderSpecificInfo, with the following syntax:
			u16 sizeof_header;
			char *header_data;
		for each header (quite similar to what is found in qtcomponents). Vorbis ObjectTypeIndication is 0xDE, theora ObjectTypeIndication is 0xDF.
		Need some more testing before filing a request to mp4ra.org.
		Streaming possible as MPEG-4 streams, Vorbis RTP packetizer still to be done.

	- moved all scene decoders (bifs, OD and context loader) to real plugins
	- moved BT & XMT parsers from stdio to ZLIB io, in order to support GZIPed VRML & X3D (and consequently, BT and XMT-A ;). GPAC CAN NO LONGER COMPILE WITHOUT ZLIB
