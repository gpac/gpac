This directory contains a basic SDK for Platinum and Neptune libraries, version 0.5.4.

Platinum has been slightly modified for GPAC usage:
	support for PresentationURL in device description reading. 
	few workarounds for windowsCE compilation

For most (99%) cases and most platforms, using the original platinum will work. 

The patched platinum library sources and binaries can be found here:
